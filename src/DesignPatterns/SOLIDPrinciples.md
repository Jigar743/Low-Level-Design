##### Design principles (SOLID designs):
1. Single responsibility principle (SRP).
2. Open close principle (OCP).
3. Liskov's substitution principle.
4. Interface segregation principle.
5. Dependency inversion principle.

### SRP
* There should be only one reason for a class/code unit to change.
  Every class should have only one responsibility.
* every code unit (Class/Methods/Package) should have exactly 1 responsibility.

### OCP
* Codebase should be open for extension, but close for modifications.
